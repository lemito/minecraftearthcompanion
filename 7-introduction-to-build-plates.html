            <div class="list-item-description">
                <p>Build plates are small sections of the Minecraft world, which you can build and play on.</p>
                <p>They come in all different sizes. Some fit on tables, and others in your garden! Speaking of gardens, that's probably a good place to build a muddy pig farm! They love rolling around on the floor!</p>
                <p>Everyone starts with the basic build plate, which is a small 10Ã—10 section of a plains biome.</p>
                <p>You can unlock more build plates as you level up. As you can imagine, the bigger and cooler looking ones get unlocked at the higher levels, whilst the smaller ones are easier and quicker to unlock.</p>
                <p>You can place blocks and mobs, and they'll behave exactly as you'd expect. Water flows, crops grow, and fire spreads!</p>
                <p>You can mine all the blocks in your build plate, all the way down to bedrock. All of the blocks that you mine get added right into your inventory.</p>
