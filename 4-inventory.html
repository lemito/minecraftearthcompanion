            <div class="list-item-description">
            <p>Your inventory is where you store all your blocks, just like in regular Minecraft. However, in Minecraft Earth, the mobs you collect will be stored here too! You also have an unlimited amount of inventory space, so don't worry about having too many items!</p>
            <p>Blocks in your inventory can either be placed, or traded in for XP. The more XP you have, the higher level your player will be. We'll learn more about this later.</p>

            <h3 class="list-item-title">Your character</h3>
            <div class="list-item-description">
            <p>Your player in Minecraft Earth shows where you are in relation to the real world. The houses and streets around you are all shown on your screen, like a map!</p>
            <p>The pulsing circle around your player shows what's in your range. If something is inside the circle, you can tap on it to interact with it.</p>
            <p>You can also of course change your players skin. All skins which you've unlocked on Xbox can be used in Minecraft Earth, plus many more!</p>
